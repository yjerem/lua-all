# All Versions of Lua

This repo contains every version of [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) that has been
released. It is [lua-all.tar.gz](https://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-all.tar.gz) in the
form of a Git repo: each commit contains the source code of a particular
version of Lua, and the commits are chained together in the order that the
versions were released.

All commits are tagged with the Lua version. Use `git tag` to list all
available versions, and `git checkout 5.3.4` to check out the source code for
version 5.3.4, for example.

`makerepo.rb` is a Ruby script that generates this repo from the contents of
`lua-all.tar.gz`.

## Original `README`

> To accompany the presentation of the evolution of Lua at HOPL III,
> here are all releases of Lua. Only the source code is included; for
> documentation and other files, see the original tarballs at Lua.org.
>
> The code has been slightly updated to compile and run with gcc 4. As a
> testimony to the portability of Lua, the required changes were minimal:
> just a trivial change in iolib.c before Lua 2.5. The differences between
> the original code and the updated code are in DIFFS in each directory.
>
> No attempt has been made to ensure warning-free compilations. A few,
> mostly trivial, changes would be needed for that, but it is interesting
> to see the number of warnings decrease to zero in later versions.
>
> To build each release, just go its directory and type 'make'. This will
> run a simple test for lua and luac (when available). To build and test
> all releases, just type 'make' at the top level directory.
>
> The simple Makefiles build Lua without any special options. For those,
> see the original tarballs.
>
> Lua 3.2 may crash when run if compiled with gcc 4. It runs fine in earlier gcc.
>
> Enjoy!
